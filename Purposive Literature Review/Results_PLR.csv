CJM Phase;Pain Point;Reference
Phase 2: Requirements Elicitation;The lack of clarity in the project description hindered me in defining the scope of the model.;[1] [2] [29]
;It was a challenge to translate the needs of the projects and the stakeholders into model requirements.;[3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
Phase 4: Model Creation;I had trouble defining the right level of abstraction and this affected my judgment as to what to include or not in the model. ;[8] [9] [10]
;I did not know the right time to stop modeling.;[10] [21] [29]
;I could not find any formal technical material (e.g. manuals, books) to consult when I had doubts about the language I had chosen. ;[10] [11] [12]
;I did not know how to increase my model's comprehensibility.;[13] [14] [15]
;Developing the model was hard because the modeling team was not sufficiently skilled in modeling.;[16] [17] [18] [19] [20]
Phase 5: Model Testing and Evaluation;I verified my model but did not understand the errors in it.;[21] [24]
;I verified my model but did not know how to solve the errors in it.;[22] [23] [24]
;The model allowed for unintended interpretations and I did not know how to fix it.;[22] [25] [26] [27]
;The model did not allow for all the intended interpretations and I did not know how to fix it.;[25] [26] [27]
Phase 8: Model Maintenance;I was the only one on the team interested in using and reusing the model.;[28] [30]
;The model was insufficient to achieve its application objective.;[29] [31] [32]
