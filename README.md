# The Pain Points of Domain Modeling

The present repository consolidates the findings and replication materials from studies on the pain points of domain modeling. It is organized into two files, each corresponding to one of the papers resulting from the study.

The term "pain points", originating from the domain of Marketing, denotes instances of customer dissatisfaction stemming from not having their expectations met through their experience with a particular product and/or service.

To examine pain points in domain modeling, we conceptualize modeling as a dynamic interaction between multiple agents (e.g., modelers, domain experts, sponsors), products (e.g., models, languages, tools), and activities (e.g., requirements elicitation, concept negotiation). In this approach, pain points are instances of dissatisfaction that arise when modelers interact with other elements of the modeling process. For instance, such a moment arises when modelers and domain experts struggle to reach a shared understanding of a concept. Dissatisfaction may also occur when modelers feel overwhelmed by the manual effort involved in model verification or layout due to a tool's lack of features.

By identifying these pain points and understanding their implications for modelers and the modeling process, our studies aim to enhance modelersâ€™ experiences and improve the modeling practice. Additionally, they provide insights into the interactions among agents, products, and activities, helping practitioners anticipate and address potential challenges. Consequently, they equip the modeling community with knowledge to better plan initiatives, assess costs, identify solutions, refine methods, improve languages and tools, and guide novice modelers.

Our study was divided into two papers:

[Unrevealing the pain points of domain modeling] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584925000758) driven by the research question: 
 - What are the main pain points associated with domain modeling? 

Quantifying the pain points of doming modeling guided by the research questions: 
 - How often do modelers experience the pain points of domain modeling?
 - Why do modelers feel frustrated by these pain points?
 - How do modelers react when facing these pain points?
