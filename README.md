# pain-points-modeling

The present repository consolidates a series of pain points encountered by modelers when involved with structural conceptual modeling. Those pain points were identified through the investigation delineated in publication X.

A comprehensive comprehension of this dataset holds the potential to refine and advance modeling methodologies, languages, and tools, thereby improving the experiences of modelers. Additionally, it may contribute to several objectives, including (i) assessing the costs of modeling, (ii) identifying alternative solutions to deal with modeling difficulties, and (iii) facilitating the learning process for novice modelers.

The term "pain points," originating from the domain of Marketing, denotes instances of customer dissatisfaction stemming from not having their expectations met through their experience with a particular product and/or service. Presuming that a portion of modeling costs correlates with the challenges encountered by modelers throughout the modeling process, we delve deeper into this phenomenon through an empirical study guided by the following research query: What constitutes the principal pain points of structural conceptual modeling?

This study unfolds across six distinct stages and employs five methodological approaches, as described below:

- Phase 1: Discovering the pain points 
 - Phase 1.1: Thematic Analysis 
 - Phase 1.2: Virtual Brainstorming Session
 - Phase 1.3: Purposive Literature Review 

- Phase 2: Synthesizing the pain points 
 - Phase 2.1: Qualitative Data Synthesis

- Phase 3: Prioritizing the pain points 
 - Phase 3.1: Delphy Study Round 1 - Voting Session
 - Phase 3.2: Delphy Study Round 2 - Prioritizing Session  


The materials and findings associated with each phase are documented and made available within the files contained within this repository.
