# The Pain Points of Structural Conceptual Modeling

The present repository consolidates a series of pain points encountered by modelers when involved with structural conceptual modeling. Those pain points were identified through the investigation delineated in publication X.

The term "pain points", originating from the domain of Marketing, denotes instances of customer dissatisfaction stemming from not having their expectations met through their experience with a particular product and/or service. Presuming that a portion of modeling costs correlates with the challenges encountered by modelers throughout the modeling process, we delve deeper into this phenomenon through an empirical study guided by the following research query: What constitutes the principal pain points of structural conceptual modeling?

This study unfolds across six distinct stages and employs five methodological approaches, as depicted in the figure below. The materials and findings associated with each phase are documented and made available within the files contained within this repository.

A comprehensive comprehension of this dataset holds the potential to refine and advance modeling methodologies, languages, and tools, thereby improving the experiences of modelers. Additionally, it may contribute to several objectives, including (i) assessing the costs of modeling, (ii) identifying alternative solutions to deal with modeling difficulties, and (iii) facilitating the learning process for novice modelers.

## Content Description 

- [Results_TA.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Thematic%20Analysis/Results_TA.pdf): The file comprises a table presenting the pain points identified through the thematic analysis. Each pain point is accompanied by the text extracts utilized to substantiate its assertion. These extracts were drawn from nine semi-structured interviews with researchers and practitioners who worked on projects in Brazil, Italy, and the Netherlands.

Note that the pain points highlighted in gray within the table are those that garnered a minimum of two votes and were consequently included in the prioritization session.

- [Round 1_Virtual Workplace Design](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Delphi%20Study/Round%201_Voting%20Session/Round%201_Virtual%20Workplace%20Design.pdf): The file is an image depicting the virtual workspace as visualized by the participant during the voting session.

- [Prioritization Sessions](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/tree/main/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Prioritization%20Sessions): The folder comprises the outcomes of the prioritization session conducted by each participant.

- [Round 2_Matrix Weighting System](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Round%202_Matrix%20Weighting%20System.pdf): The file is an image depicting the matrix weighting system used as a reference to quantify the prioritization conducted by the participants during the prioritization sessions.

- [Round 2_Results.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Round%202_Results.pdf): The file comprises three tables presenting the prioritizations conducted by the participants during the prioritization sessions. Table 1 presents the prioritizations conducted by beginners, Table 2 presents the prioritizations conducted by experts, and Table 3 presents both prioritizations, ranking the results by mean. Note that, in Table 3, pain points highlighted in green were prioritized by both beginner and expert modelers, while those highlighted in yellow were prioritized solely by beginners, and those highlighted in blue were prioritized solely by experts. 

- [Round 2_Virtual Workplace Design](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Round%202_Virtual%20Workplace%20Design.pdf.pdf): The file is an image depicting the virtual workspace as visualized by the participant during the prioritization session.
