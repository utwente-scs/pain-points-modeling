# Mapping the pain: How modelers experience and respond to common domain modeling frustrations

The present file consolidates the findings and supplementary material for the study presented in Mapping the pain: How modelers experience and respond to common domain modeling frustrations.

In this study, we conducted an online survey targeting modelers with experience in domain modeling. The research followed the survey process illustrated in the figure below. We got 49 responses from a diverse sample in terms of years of experience, activities performed, and application context. The analysis focuses on describing patterns in the data rather than drawing statistical inferences.
