# The Pain Points of Domain Modeling

The present file consolidates the supplementary material for the study presented in Quantifying the pain points of domain modeling. 

In this study, we conducted an online survey targeting modelers with experience in domain modeling. We got 49 responses from a diverse sample in terms of years of experience, activities performed, and application context. The study focuses on descriptive analysis over statistical inference.
