- [Results_TA.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Thematic%20Analysis/Results_TA.pdf): The file comprises a table presenting the 16 pain points identified through the thematic analysis. Each pain point is accompanied by the text extracts utilized to substantiate its assertion. These extracts were drawn from nine semi-structured interviews with researchers and practitioners who worked on projects in Brazil, Italy, and the Netherlands.

- [Results_VBS.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Virtual%20Brainstorming%20Session/Results_VBS.pdf) The file comprises a table presenting the 42 pain points identified through the virtual brainstorming session. Each pain point is linked to the participant who identified it. The session involved the participation of a diverse group of six structural conceptual modelers, ensuring fair representation across two factors: modeling expertise (novices and experts) and professional background (practitioners and academics).

Each pain point is paired with the references utilized to substantiate its assertion. The references are listed below the table for further review. 

- [Results_QDS.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Qualitative%20Data%20Synthesis/Results_QDS.pdf): The file comprises a table presenting the 41 pain points resulting from the qualitative data synthesis.

- [Round 1_Results.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Delphi%20Study/Round%201_Voting%20Session/Round%201_Results.pdf): The file comprises a table presenting the count of votes submitted by each participant in each voting session. Note that the 19 pain points highlighted in gray within the table are those that garnered a minimum of two votes and were consequently included in the prioritization session.

- [Round 1_Virtual Workspace Design](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Delphi%20Study/Round%201_Voting%20Session/Round%201_Virtual%20Workspace%20Design.pdf): The file is an image depicting the virtual workspace as visualized by the participant during the voting session.

- [Prioritization Sessions](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/tree/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Prioritization%20Sessions): The folder comprises the outcomes of the prioritization session conducted by each participant.

- [Round 2_Matrix Weighting System](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Round%202_Matrix%20Weighting%20System.pdf): The file is an image depicting the matrix weighting system used as a reference to quantify the prioritization conducted by the participants during the prioritization sessions.

- [Round 2_Results.pdf](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Round%202_Results.pdf): The file comprises three tables presenting the prioritizations conducted by the participants during the prioritization sessions. Table 1 presents the prioritizations conducted by beginners, Table 2 presents the prioritizations conducted by experts, and Table 3 presents both prioritizations, ranking the results by mean. Note that, in Table 3, pain points highlighted in green were prioritized by both beginner and expert modelers, while those highlighted in yellow were prioritized solely by beginners, and those highlighted in blue were prioritized solely by experts. These 16 highlighted pain points are the most frequent and have the greatest impact on the structural conceptual modeling experience according to the modelers who participated in the study. 

- [Round 2_Virtual Workspace Design](https://github.com/utwente-scs/pain-points-modeling/blob/main/Unrevealing%20the%20pain%20points%20of%20domain%20modeling%20/Delphi%20Study/Round%202_Prioritization%20Session/Round%202_Virtual%20Workspace%20Design.pdf.pdf): The file is an image depicting the virtual workspace as visualized by the participant during the prioritization session.
