CJM Phase;Pain Point;Participant;
Phase 1: Modeling Approach Definition and Justification;I spent a lot of resources on defining the model-driven approach because, for instance, my company did not have a modeling culture.;P6.E;
;As licensing professional tools may take time, I had to work with non-ideal resources. Moreover, changing tools during the process was unfeasible due to the timeline.;P6.E;
;I could not find a model-driven working method ready to use.;P4.E;
;I struggled to find a model-driven methodology that suited the needs of my stakeholders and was technically sound.;P5.E;
;I was not sure which modeling tool to choose.  All of them have many more features than I needed. I did not know which features I wanted, so it was not obvious which tool to choose.;P4.E;
;I felt that model-driven methodologies did not stimulate collaboration. I was hoping to find one that allowed for social construction, but I could not.;P1.B;
;It took me a lot of effort to understand the model-driven working methods available and to identify the one that best suited the scope of the model I aimed to create.;P2.B;
;I had difficulties explaining to others why I chose a given modeling language and what criteria I used.;P1.B;
;While searching for model-driven methods, I encountered literature primarily focused on the creation of reference models with limited emphasis on models for application.;P1.B;
;I missed more lean and agile working methods for model development. Maybe they exist but I did not find them.;P1.B;
;While searching, I missed a collaborative modeling tool in which stakeholders could interact throughout the modeling process.;P1.B;
Phase 2: Requirements Elicitation;My lack of domain knowledge made it difficult for me to understand the problem and propose a solution.;P5.E;
;The abstract nature of conceptual models made it difficult for me to define clear and objective requirements.;P1.B;
Phase 3: Knowledge Acquisition;I felt that even the domain experts did not have reliable knowledge about the domain.;P3.B;
;It took me a lot of effort to negotiate a common definition among the stakeholders about an aspect of the domain that was not properly understood.;P6.E;
;The domain experts were not available as much as I needed.;P4.E;
;I had trouble dealing with the material about the domain (e.g. documentation, regulations, books). It was very boring!;P4.E;
;I did not have much experience in extracting domain knowledge from experts.;P5.E;
;I was not confident that my understanding of the domain was sufficient. It was a very dynamic subject.;P3.B;
;It was hard to deal with the complexity and contradictory aspects of the domain and find the right criteria for deciding which conceptualization to adopt.;P1.B;
Phase 4: Model Creation;I was unsure how to categorize the domain aspects (e.g. concepts) according to the specifications of the language I chose.;P4.E;
;I found it difficult to use the tool I had chosen. I did not know how to handle its features. It was complicated and had some bugs.;P2.B;
;I was not sure which classes and relations should go in my diagram. I did not want to increase its complexity unnecessarily.;P4.E;
;I wanted to reuse an existing model, but I had to redraw it from scratch. I am not sure it would be worth it!;P4.E;
;Manually splitting the model into visually appealing and understandable views required a lot of work.;P5.E;
;I changed something in a class and then had to reorganize several diagrams in which the class occurred.;P4.E;
;Writing definitions for the elements in my model was hard and boring.;P4.E;
;The modeling language I chose was not intuitive. There were too many details and specifications, and I was not confident that I was using it correctly.;P2.B;
;I could not make one of my diagrams look good.;P4.E;
;I felt there was a lack of formal guidelines for creating model views. I would like to learn strategies to reduce the model's complexity and make it easier to understand.;P1.B;
;The other stakeholders did not consider it important to document the model and did not understand my efforts to do so.;P6.E;
;I did not have much knowledge of logic and it was hard to translate the domain constraints into the model.;P1.B;
;I tried to reuse an existing model but found it very difficult to adapt it my needs.;P1.B;
;I felt there was a lack of formal guidelines for documenting conceptual models. I was not sure which documents should accompany my model.;P2.B;
;I had a hard time identifying the domain constraints that were relevant to my model.;P1.B;
Phase 5: Model Testing and Evaluation;The tool I chose did not support model verification. My model was large and complex and verifying it by myself was not trivial!;P5.E;
;Validating the model with the domain experts was challenging because they were not used to the modeling language I used.;P5.E;
;I was not sure if my model was good enough.;P4.E;
Phase 6: Model Implementation;I feel like I was repeating myself when creating my database schema (or OWL ontology).;P4.E;
Phase 7: Model Verbalization;It took me a lot of effort to generate verbalizations of my model suitable for the different audiences that should be able to read it.;P4.E;
Phase 8: Model Maintenance;It was challenging for me to change the model while trying to reduce the impacts and keep its consistency.;P1.B;
;I found it a very demanding task to keep the model and its documentation updated.;P1.B;
