I was not sure how to document my model.;5;1;1;1;1;1;;
My stakeholders resisted adopting modeling, a modeling language, or a tool because, e.g., they did not think it was worth it or I could not show its value.;4;1;1;;;1;1;
I could not properly define the model requirements because, e.g., my stakeholders did not know exactly what they needed or the domain was unfamiliar to me.  ;4;1;;1;;1;1;
Writing definitions for the elements in my model was hard and boring.;4;1;1;1;1;;;
The tool I chose did not support model verification. My model was large and complex and verifying it by myself was not trivial.;4;1;;;1;1;1;
I had difficulty explaining my model to my stakeholders/domain experts.;4;1;1;1;1;;;
It was costly to generate verbalizations of my model suitable for the different audiences that should be able to read and use it.;4;1;1;1;;1;;
It was costly to define the model-driven approach because, e.g., my company did not have a modeling culture or I was not knowledgeable enough.;3;1;1;1;;;;
It was costly to define the model requirements because, e.g., there were too many stakeholders.;3;1;1;;;1;;
It was costly to negotiate a common definition among the experts about a concept of the project's domain of interest.;3;1;;1;;1;;
It was costly to manually split the model into visually appealing and understandable views (diagrams).;3;1;1;1;;;;
The model has become too complex and too costly to maintain because, e.g., the tool did not support documentation or there were too many elements.;3;1;;;1;;1;
I could not choose the modeling tool I wanted because of, e.g., cost, expertise, culture, or bureaucracy.;2;;;;1;1;;
I was the only one on the team with experience in modeling. So I did everything myself. I wish I had had someone to discuss the challenges.;2;1;;;;1;;
I wanted to reuse an existing model, but I had to redraw it from scratch. ;2;;;;;1;1;
I could not make one of my diagrams look good.;2;1;;;1;;;
My colleagues did not consider it important to document the model and did not understand my efforts to do so.;2;;;;;1;1;
I was the only one on the team interested in using and reusing the model.;2;;;;1;1;;
I felt like I was repeating myself when manually creating my database schema (or OWL vocabulary).;2;1;;;;;1;
I was not sure which modeling tool to choose because, e.g., there were many alternatives, too many features, or the requirements were not clear.;1;1;;;;;;
I could not find a model-driven methodology ready to use.;1;;;;;1;;
I struggled to find a model-driven methodology that suited the needs of my stakeholders and was technically sound.;1;1;;;;;;
It was costly to learn the project's domain of interest because, e.g., I did not have experience in extracting domain knowledge from experts or they were not sufficiently available.;1;1;;;;;;
I was insecure about my knowledge about the project's domain of interest because, e.g., the domain was complex or the experts were not reliable.;1;1;;;;;;
I could not accurately represent the project's domain of interest because, e.g., the language was not expressive enough or the tool did not fully implement the language.;1;;;;1;;;
I found it difficult to use the tool I had chosen. I did not know how to handle its features. It was complicated and had some bugs.;1;1;;;;;;
I did not know the right time to stop modeling. I was unsure if my model was ready to be used and had everything needed.;1;1;;;;;;
I did not know how to increase my model's comprehensibility.;1;1;;;;;;
I changed something in a class and then had to reorganize several diagrams in which the class occurs.;1;;1;;;;;
Creating the model took more effort than I expected, which resulted in unforeseen costs. ;1;;;;;;1;
I was not sure if my model was good enough.;1;1;;;;;;
My model was under- and/or over-constrained and I did not know how to fix it!;1;1;;;;;;
The model was insufficient to achieve its application objective and I had to rework it.;1;1;;;;;;
My model was not (re)used because, e.g., my colleagues could not or did not want to use or it was not ready on time.;1;1;;;;;;
I could not clarify my doubts about the language I had chosen because, e.g., there is no reference material (e.g. manuals, books) or community forum.;0;;;;;;;
I was not sure which classes and relations should go in my diagram.;0;;;;;;;
I was not comfortable using the language I chose because, e.g., it was not intuitive, I did not have enough training, or I did not know logic. ;0;;;;;;;
I wanted to reuse an existing model, but I had difficulty understanding it because, e.g., I only had access to part of it or it was poorly documented.;0;;;;;;;
I verified my model but did not understand the errors in it.;0;;;;;;;
I verified my model but did not know how to solve the errors in it.;0;;;;;;;
I left the project and there was no one to maintain the model.;0;;;;;;;
