I could not properly define the model requirements because, e.g., my stakeholders did not know exactly what they needed or the domain was unfamiliar to me.;5,7;6;5;6;;;;
My stakeholders resisted adopting modeling, a modeling language, or a tool because, e.g., they did not think it was worth it or I could not show its value.;5,3;4;6;6;;;;
It was costly to negotiate a common definition among the experts about a concept of the project's domain of interest.;5,3;5;5;6;;;;
It was costly to define the model requirements because, e.g., there were too many stakeholders.;5,0;5;4;6;;;;
I had difficulty explaining my model to my stakeholders/domain experts.;5,0;5;6;4;;;;
It was costly to generate verbalizations of my model suitable for the different audiences that should be able to read and use it.;4,7;5;4;5;;;;
Writing definitions for the elements in my model was hard and boring.;4,7;4;4;6;;;;
It was costly to manually split the model into visually appealing and understandable views (diagrams).;4,7;5;6;3;;;;
The model has become too complex and too costly to maintain because, e.g., the tool did not support documentation or there were too many elements.;4,0;3;5;4;;;;
I was not sure how to document my model.;4,0;4;3;5;;;;
It was costly* to define the model-driven approach because, e.g., my company did not have a modeling culture or I was not knowledgeable enough.;3,7;4;5;2;;;;
My colleagues did not consider it important to document the model and did not understand my efforts to do so.;3,7;5;3;3;;;;
I wanted to reuse an existing model, but I had to redraw it from scratch.;3,3;3;4;3;;;;
I could not choose the modeling tool I wanted because of, e.g., cost, expertise, culture, or bureaucracy. ;3,3;4;4;2;;;;
I felt like I was repeating myself when manually creating my database schema (or OWL vocabulary).;3,3;4;4;2;;;;
The tool I chose did not support model verification. My model was large and complex and verifying it by myself was not trivial.;3,0;3;4;2;;;;
I was the only one on the team interested in using and reusing the model.;3,0;5;2;2;;;;
I was the only one on the team with experience in modeling. So I did everything myself. I wish I had had someone to discuss the challenges.;3,0;4;3;2;;;;
I could not make one of my diagrams look good.;3,0;5;2;2;;;;
